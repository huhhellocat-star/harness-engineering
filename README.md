# harness-engineering

`harness-engineering` is a portable Agent Skill that helps coding agents (Codex, Claude Code, and other compatible clients) follow best practices in product development and project modification.

The skill brings together insights from OpenAI's harness engineering paradigm, Anthropic's multi-agent research, and the community's Ralph pattern into actionable playbooks, templates, and principles that agents use automatically.

## What It Does

When triggered, this skill gives agents:

- **A startup audit** — fast harness check when entering any new repository
- **Workflow routing** — playbooks for common scenarios (new project, feature dev, long-running build, refactoring, bugfix)
- **Ready-to-use templates** — for instruction files, handoff artifacts, sprint contracts, evaluator rubrics, and progress tracking
- **Core principles** — repo as system of record, map not encyclopedia, separate planning/doing/judging, verify against reality, structured handoffs, incremental commits, entropy management
- **Context engineering** — progressive disclosure, context resets vs compaction, fresh context reliability
- **Multi-agent patterns** — when and how to use planner/generator/evaluator architecture

## Install

Copy the `harness-engineering/` skill directory into the location your client scans for skills.

### Codex

Personal install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R harness-engineering ~/.codex/skills/
```

Project install:

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/repo/.agents/skills
cp -R harness-engineering /path/to/repo/.agents/skills/
```

### Claude Code

Personal install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -R harness-engineering ~/.claude/skills/
```

Project install:

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/repo/.claude/skills
cp -R harness-engineering /path/to/repo/.claude/skills/
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

Personal install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.copilot/skills
cp -R harness-engineering ~/.copilot/skills/
```

## Verify

After installing, ask the agent "what skills are available" or start a task that involves project setup, code review, or long-running development. The skill should trigger automatically.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Repo as system of record** | Everything the agent needs lives in the repo — Slack, tickets, and memory don't count |
| **Map, not encyclopedia** | Instruction files are ~100-line directories pointing to deeper docs |
| **Separate planning, doing, judging** | Don't let one agent spec, implement, and grade itself |
| **Make quality gradable** | Convert "make it better" into concrete, weighted criteria |
| **Verify against reality** | Test the running product, not just the code |
| **Structured handoffs** | Context reset + handoff artifact beats a bloated session |
| **Work incrementally** | One feature at a time, commit often, test each feature |
| **Manage entropy** | Agents replicate patterns — including bad ones. Encode good patterns as lint rules. |
| **Complexity earns its keep** | Every harness component is a claim the model can't do X. Stress-test those claims. |

## Playbooks

| Playbook | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| [New Project](harness-engineering/playbooks/new-project.md) | Starting from scratch — spec expansion, scaffold, incremental build |
| [Feature Development](harness-engineering/playbooks/feature-development.md) | Adding features to an existing codebase |
| [Long-Running Build](harness-engineering/playbooks/long-running-build.md) | Multi-hour/multi-session autonomous development |
| [Refactor & Cleanup](harness-engineering/playbooks/refactor-cleanup.md) | Tech debt, code cleanup, architectural improvement |
| [Bug Investigation](harness-engineering/playbooks/bugfix-investigation.md) | Reproduce → diagnose → test → fix → prevent |
